# Local Change Detection in Angular

Open the console. You will see a log statement every time Angular runs the Change Detection for the `TimerComponent` and `ListComponent`.

You will notice that it regularly checks the `TimeComponent` but not the `ListComponent`.

This is only possible from Angular 17 onwards and is the local change detection.
